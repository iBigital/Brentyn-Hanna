      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Brentyn Hanna and this is my business: engineering creative
        software solutions!
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, I hope to become an aerospace engineer with ambitions to
        not only one day build rockets, but fly them too.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am passionate about space, but keep my head grounded learning to write
        sensibly clean code and maintaining efficient hardware with minimal as
        possible environmental impact.

        You are personally supporting my life's ambitions by taking the time to
        read what I am all about (and boosting my SEO by just staying on this
        site).
