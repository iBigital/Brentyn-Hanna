        My name is Brentyn Hanna and this is my business: engineering creative
        tools and software solutions!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the future, I intend to become an aerospace engineer with ambitions to
        work on crewed missions and perphaps participate as well. My dream job would be
        to work at or closely with NASA or a similar non-profit space or science
        organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep my head grounded learning to write
        sensibly clean code and maintaining efficient hardware with minimal as
        possible environmental impact. As of late my volunteering efforts have
        been minimal, but previously I'd give lots of time to helping my
        community as well through programs such as Key Club.
