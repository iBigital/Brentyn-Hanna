      <h1>About</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        My name is Brentyn Hanna and this is my business: engineering creative
        tools and software solutions!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the future, I hope to become an aerospace engineer with ambitions to
        not only one day build rockets, but fly them too. My dream job would be to work 
        at or closely with NASA or a similar non-profit space or science organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am passionate about space, but keep my head grounded learning to write
        sensibly clean code and maintaining efficient hardware with minimal as
        possible environmental impact. As of late my volunteering efforts have been minimal, 
        but previously I'd give lots of time to helping my community as well through programs
        such as Key Club.
